## Revenue Streams 
We see two potential revenue streams:

1. Partnership with private companies and Tourism Offices in order to promote specific itineraries making them appear on the feed of more customers. For instance, a bar owner could sponsor existing itineraries or create an itinerary that include a stop at the place. 
2. Advertisement seamlessly included in the user experience of the app in. Meaning the advertisement has the form of an itinerary in the feed, in order not to disturb the user as some pop up advertisement could.
