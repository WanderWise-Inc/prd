# History


The idea for WanderWise emerged from recognizing that travel planning was often inefficient and stressful, discouraging people from discovering new itineraries in their city or the one that they are visiting. If you're a traveler and you visit a new city, more than often you would be tempted to only visit spots that are either highly touristic or that aren't far from your place of stay. This realization led to the development of a mobile app designed to simplify and enhance the process of creating and finding travel itineraries, while also building a community of travelers.

The development from concept to prototype provided valuable insights. The integration of the Google Maps API was crucial, enabling real-time navigation and customizable routes, which improved the user experience significantly. Additionally, user feedback confirmed the importance of social features like liking, saving, and sharing itineraries, highlighting the community aspect of the app.
User tests showed that while users liked the intuitive design and easy itinerary customization, they wanted more advanced filtering options to quickly find itineraries based on specific criteria such as budget, duration, and themes.

To evolve from a proof of concept (PoC) to a minimum viable product (MVP), several improvements were necessary: <br>

**Enhanced Personalization**: We bridged the gap with other apps by quickly integrating personalization features such as tags and price-time bracket choice.<br>
**Cross-Platform Availability**: Extending availability to iOS is critical to reach a wider audience and test the appâ€™s effectiveness across different user groups, but we plan to attain that after making sure that our android implementation.<br>
**Scalability and Performance**: It's vital to ensure the app can support a high volume of users and itineraries without performance issues, requiring backend optimization and cloud solutions for scalability thanks to our firebase utilization.<br>
**Advanced Search and Filtering**: More detailed search options are needed to allow users to efficiently find ideal itineraries. This could include filters for accessibility features or user ratings.<br>
**Marketing and Community Building**: A strategic marketing campaign is crucial to attract initial users and build a community. This should include digital marketing and collaboration with travel influencers to increase the app's visibility and credibility.<br>

By addressing these areas, WanderWise aims to progress from a functional PoC to an MVP that demonstrates its value and appeals to early adopters and potential investors.
