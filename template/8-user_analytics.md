# User Analytics and Acceptance
This section will focus on how user behaviour will be tracked and how the successes of the app will be measured. The goal will be to understand how users are using the app.

## Which are the key metrics?
There are several significant metrics and key performance metrics we will use to quantify user engagement, adoption and retention as well as performance.

1. User engagement metrics: daily active users, session length, app usage frequency
1. User adoption metrics: new users sign-ups, conversion rates from app download to active app usage, conversion from free to premium features
1. User retention metrics: number of returning users in a period of 30 days, churn rate (ratio of lost users by initial users over a time interval)
1. Performance metrics: Analyze page load times
