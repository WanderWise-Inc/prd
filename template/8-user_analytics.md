# User Analytics and Acceptance
This section will focus on how we will track user behaviour and how the successes of the app will be measured. The goal will be to understand how users are using the app. These metrics will also allow us to identify bugs and parts of our app that need to be improved.

## Key metrics
There are several significant metrics and key performance metrics we will use to quantify user engagement, adoption and retention as well as performance.

1. **User engagement metrics**: daily active users, session length, app usage frequency
1. **User adoption metrics**: new user sign-ups, conversion rates from app download to active app usage, conversion from free to premium features
1. **User retention metrics**: number of returning users in a period of 30 days, churn rate (ratio of lost users by initial users over a time interval)
1. **Performance metrics**: Analyze page load times, crash rate and bug rate.

## Success criteria
The following criteria will determine user acceptance and overall app success.

1. **Performance**: low page load time (e.g. less than 2 seconds), low crash rate and fast bug fixes.
1. **Acceptance**: high user engagement, adoption and retention (priority on user retention)

## User Analytics
User analytics involve the collection, measurement, and analysis of data related to how users interact with the product.

1. Use Google Analytics to user behaviour, navigation patterns and feature preferences
1. Collect demographic and behavioural information on users to adapt the suggested features to each user's profile.

## A/B testing ideas
A/B Testing is a method used to compare two versions of the app or a feature of the app to determine which one performs better in terms of the above metrics. Here are some A/B testing ideas:

1. Experiment with different itinerary banners to optimize the information displayed.
1. Experiment with different itinerary creation processes (loading bar to show progress) to improve ease of use and encourage itinerary creation.
1. Experiment with different navigation layouts to optimize user friendliness.
