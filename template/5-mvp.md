# The MVP

## Personas and Scenarios

The target personas are:
- *The explorer*: an open-minded individual seeking to expose themself to novel experiences.
- *The guide*: a community-focused individual that enjoys sharing their experiences, actively seeking a sense of social validation through contributing to the community.
- *The lazy wanderer*: an individual that wants to relax, and bypassthe overhead of planning out their off-days.
- *The careful planner*: an individual that may be accompanied by their family, potentially including elders or children. This person's main concern is planning out activities that are adapted to their situation.

The key persona is the *lazy wanderer* as this person is essentially outsourcing planning tasks by using the WanderWise app. Moreover this implies that this person is more-likely to pay for features that reduce friction in any way shape or form.

*High-level scenarios to adopt, use and share the product.*

Word-of-mouth is the best and free marketing tool that the WanderWise could make use of. People love sharing travel tips, any one of the above personas would feel relieved by using the WanderWise app which makes them very likely to share the product.

## User Stories and Key Features

### User stories for *the explorer*

    1. As an explorer currently in my home town, I would like to go on to rediscover my surroundings from a novel point of view as this would fulfill my need to *get out there* at any time. 
    2. As an explorer currently in a new city, I would like to discover a new culture by doing some local activities in order to live an other person's experience.

For this to happen, the WanderWise app should provide *the explorer* with a relevant recommendation feed that keeps some novelty in order not to have the explorer repeat the same / similar activites as what matters most to them is novelty.

### User stories for *the guide*:

    1. As a guide, I would like to be able to create and share itineraries as I would like to be able to contribute to the community in order to feel socially validated.
    2. As a guide, I would like ot be able to have some form of feedback from the people that followed my itineraries as I would like to provide the best possible itineraries in order to feel socially validated.

For this to happen, the WanderWeise app should provide *the guide* with an itinerary creation feature that allows him to easily create itineraries. Moreover the WanderWise app should provide *the guide* with an easy way for them to share the itineraries. This means that users should be able to post their on other social media plateforms / messaging apps.

### User stories for the *lazy wanderer*

    1. As a lazy wanderer I would like to easily find an itinerary that will occupy me during my free time as all I care about is to have something to do without thinking too much on the what to do.

For this to happen the WanderWise app should provide users with a relevant itinerary in their recommendation feed. 

### User stories for the *careful planner*

    1. As a careful planner I would like to be able to find itineraries that match my criterion as I would like to ensure that the activities are adapted to my situation.
    2. As a careful planner I would like to have access to reviews of the itineraries as I would like to have social proof that the itinerary is well suited to my situation given that someone in a similar situation confirmed it.

For this to happen, the WanderWise app should provide the users with an extensive criterion entry capability (time, price, suitability for people with reduced mobility, children..).
Moreover the WanderWise app should provide the capability to comment and read comments on public itineraries.

The key features selected for the MVP are:

- The ability to create itineraries
This is a central feature as *the guide* couldn't do its job. Moreover, the users would be limited in their feed as we (the company) couldn't provide them with the infinite range of possible activities. Outsourcing the process of creating the object of attention is by fare a better fit to our users need and a much more scalable solution.
- The abiltity to share itineraries
This is also a central feature, the app can be an entry point for someone looking to seek novel experience (as *the explorer* would) but the other personas would care about someone they know sharing a WanderWise itinerary to them, further social-proofing the itinerary (which *the careful planner* would thoroughly enjoy)
- The ability to have a feed of itineraries
This feature is also central as it would improve the users' experience on the app, and allowing *the explorer* and the *lazy wanderer* to use the app.
- The ability to filter the itineraries based on my preferences
It is primordial to have users find the an itinerary matching their preferences. The broke student and the investment banker most probably don't have the same budget. The mother a 2 years old child may not want to scroll through the same itineraries as the 22 years old adrenaline addict. In essence this feature allows for a broader clientèle. Why don't we (as a company) remove the haystack if we know where our user’s needle is ?
- The ability to comment and like an itinerary
Users want to be able to trust the itinerary they are going to follow. In order to do so having likes and comments social-proofing the itineraries would make both *the careful planner* and *the guide* happy.


## Success Criteria
The success of the MVP will be measured by:

1. The adoption rate: how many new users onboard on the app every month ?
2. The activity rate: On average how many times do our users interact with the app per month ? 
3. Satisfaction rating: what is our google play store rating ? How is our trustpilot rating ?

## Features Outside the Scope
- The Generation of personalized itineraries using by discussing with an AI.
This features should be integrated into the app after we have gathered enough data, meaning we have some a few thousands itineraries available in order to fine-tune a Large Language Model with which users could then interact in order to create an itinerary.
