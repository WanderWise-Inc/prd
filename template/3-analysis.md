# Analysis of the Situation

WanderWise finds itself somewhere between already popular concepts, combining
them in its own unique and harmonious way. Large social networks such as 
TikTok or Instagram posess large sub-communities of user's that share and 
consume travel-content. Location service providers like Google grant access
intricate navigation to the end-user. WanderWise aims to bridge the gap between
these worlds, by gamifying the process of creating and consuming location data.
In this sense, WanderWise is unique in its approach, and has no direct 
competitors. That being said, any service fighting for the user's screen time 
is an indirect competitor. Ikea (major global couch-provider) is our biggest
competitor, as their mission is to keep people inside and thus not outside 
following itineraries and discovering the world.

Our complementary products will be social media platforms. Instead of competing
against them by building a social network from the ground up, we aim to
make sharing WanderWise itineraries second nature when it comes to creating and
posting travel content on their platforms (for example, via link that redirects 
to the itinerary). It will function as an indirect and very interactive add-on.
Having platform agnostic links also opens the door to new users from a whole
variety of social media platforms.
