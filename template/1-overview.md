# Overview

WanderWise is an innovative travel app designed to facilitate trip planning and 
exploration. At its core, the project aims to simplify the stressful process of 
itinerary creation and discovery. Users can seamlessly access a list of curated 
itineraries crafted by fellow travelers, while also having the freedom to create 
and share their own personalized routes.
The purpose of WanderWise is to remove the hassle and uncertainty associated 
with planning trips by providing a platform where users can easily access and 
contribute to a diverse array of travel itineraries. Through intuitive 
features such as customizable routes, detailed tagging options (including price, 
time, and thematic tags), and the ability to toggle between public and private 
itineraries, WanderWise empowers users to tailor their travel experiences to 
their preferences and needs. 
Our app is free, and primarily targets the 18 to 35 
year age range that travel independently and are active on social media.

The app is mostly indepedent of third party services, with the exception of 
some Google APIs that are used for displaying itineraries and handling 
authentication seamlessly. 
The app uses the Google Maps API for a smoother usage of an extensive existing 
platform while also allowing the user to sign in with his Google account. The 
app is free for use and was developed to target a wide age range of 18+. 
Currently only available on Android with an offline functionality to still 
access your “liked” and created itineraries, our goal is to extend to IOS for a 
larger audience.
In essence, WanderWise is your ultimate travel companion, offering a convenient 
and efficient solution for both novice and seasoned travelers alike. With 
WanderWise, embark on your next adventure with confidence, knowing that 
comprehensive trip planning is just a few taps away.
