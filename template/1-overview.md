# Overview

<p>WanderWise is an innovative travel app designed to facilitate trip planning and exploration.<br> At its core, the project aims to simplify the stressful process of itinerary creation and discovery. Users can seamlessly access a list of curated itineraries crafted by fellow travelers, while also having the freedom to create and share their own personalized routes.</p>

<p>The purpose of WanderWise is to remove the hassle and uncertainty associated with planning trips by providing a platform where users can easily access and contribute to a diverse array of travel itineraries. Through intuitive features such as customizable routes, detailed tagging options (including price, time, and thematic tags), and the ability to toggle between public and private itineraries, WanderWise empowers users to tailor their travel experiences to their preferences and needs. The user can now navigate the app for different reasons, whether he wants to create an itinerary that he went through by selecting the starting and finishing point amongst intermediates points, or interactively save an itinerary that he is currently walking, but also as mentioned before he can pick an itinerary to discover, allowing you to have a social aspect to this app so that many users can interact by discovering new trips and by “liking” them.</p>

<p>The app uses the Google Maps API for a smoother usage of an extensive existing platform while also allowing the user to sign in with his Google account. The app is free for use and was developed to target a wide age range of 18+ . Currently only available on Android with an offline functionality to still access your “liked” and created itineraries, our goal is to extend to IOS for a larger audience.</p>

<p>In essence, WanderWise is your ultimate travel companion, offering a convenient and efficient solution for both novice and seasoned travelers alike. With WanderWise, embark on your next adventure with confidence, knowing that comprehensive trip planning is just a few taps away.</p>
