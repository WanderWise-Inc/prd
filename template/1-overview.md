# Overview

WanderWise is an innovative travel app designed to facilitate trip planning and 
exploration. At its core, the project aims to simplify the stressful process of 
itinerary creation and discovery. Users can seamlessly access a list of curated 
itineraries crafted by fellow travelers, while also having the freedom to create 
and share their own personalized routes.
The purpose of WanderWise is to remove the hassle and uncertainty associated 
with planning trips by providing a platform where users can easily access and 
contribute to a diverse array of travel itineraries. Through intuitive 
features such as customizable routes, detailed tagging options (including price, 
time, and thematic tags), and the ability to toggle between public and private 
itineraries, WanderWise empowers users to tailor their travel experiences to 
their preferences and needs. Our app is free, and primarily targets the 18 to 35 
year age range that travel independently and are likely to post on social media.

The app is mostly indepedent of third party services, with the exception of 
some Google APIs that are used for displaying itineraries and handling 
authentication seamlessly. Currently, our application is only available on
android, however we aim to port it to iOS to reach a larger audience.

In essence, WanderWise is the perfect travel companion: your notebook for
jotting down memories, your tour guide for showing you new spots. It is adapted
to your needs, and is suited for novice and seasoned travelers alike.
